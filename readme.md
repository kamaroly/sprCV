### Usage
It's HTML and CSS, so it should be straightforward. Open it up, and your information to replace mine, and go. Customize as needed. It's built mobile first, with a handful of queries at 600 & 800. You might want to use higher res images for any samples you include - I didn't but your mileage may vary.

### Needs
Runs on LESS, but a compiled CSS file is also included.

### Misc
If you need a PDF for whatever job you are after, I recommend giving http://plessl.github.com/wkpdf/ a go to convert it into a PDF.
